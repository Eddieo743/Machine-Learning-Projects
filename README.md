# Hello!
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repo contains a collection of projects that I have worked on, exploring different machine learning techniques, datasets, and approaches. Each project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights, and is organized into its own folder.

# Repository structure:
data/ – Contains the dataset(s) used in the project
scripts/ – R/Python scripts used to process data, build models, and generate results
report.Rmd / report.ipynb – A reproducible report showing code, results, and evaluation


# Projects Included:

Mushroom Classification (Naive Bayes) – Predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using categorical features.

# Techniques

Classification: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
Regression: Linear Regression, Lasso/Ridge, Gradient Boosting
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling
Evaluation: Confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall
