# Hello!
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repo contains a collection of projects that I have worked on, exploring different machine learning techniques, datasets, and approaches. Each project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights, and is organized into its own folder.

## Repository structure:
Data/ – Contains the dataset(s) used in the project

Script/ – R/Python scripts used to process data, build models, and generate results

report.Rmd  – A reproducible report showing code, results, and evaluation


## Projects Included:

Mushroom Classification (Naive Bayes) – Predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using categorical features.

Home Classification (kNN) - Predicts whether homes have been remodeled based on key features such as price, number of rooms, and living area.

## Techniques

Classification: Naive Bayes, kNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Regression: Linear Regression, Lasso/Ridge, Gradient Boosting

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling

Evaluation: Confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall
