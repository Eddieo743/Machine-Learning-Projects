# Machine-Learning-Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repo contains a collection of projects that I have worked on, exploring different machine learning techniques, datasets, and approaches. Each project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights, and is organized into its own folder.
