# Decision Tree comparison: Single Tree vs Bagging vs Boosting

This project compares the performance of a single decision tree, bagging, and boosting on the wine dataset using R. A single decision tree can be too simple (high bias) or too sensitive to the training data (high sensitivity), both of which can hurt predictions. Bagging reduces variance by combining many trees, while boosting reduces bias by letting trees correct each other's mistakes. Comparing these methods on the wine dataset shows how ensembles can make models more accurate.
